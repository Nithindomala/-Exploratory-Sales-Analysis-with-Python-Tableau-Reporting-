# 🚀  Exploratory-Sales-Analysis-with-Python-Tableau-Reporting-

## 📌  Overview  
This project analyzes sales data to derive key business insights. It includes data cleaning, merging multiple months of data, and performing exploratory analysis.  

## 📌 Objectives  
- Find the best month for sales and revenue.  
- Identify the highest-selling city.  
- Determine the best time for advertisements.  
- Analyze frequently bought-together products.  
- Discover the most sold product.  

## 📌 To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csv's together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Labeling our graphs
- Created bar charts, line graphs, and more with Matplotlib, and interactive dashboards with Tableau.

## 🛠  Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- Tableau (for visualization)  

## 🔍  Key Insights  
- The highest sales occurred in **December**.  
- **San Francisco(CA)** recorded the most sales transactions.  
- The best time for advertisements is **My recommendation is around 11am (11) or 7pm (19)**.  
- **Phones and chargers** are often bought together.  
- The best-selling product was **AAA Batteries (4-pack)**.
